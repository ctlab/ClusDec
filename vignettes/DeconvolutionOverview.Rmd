## Heterogenity of samples

Samples in biological data are often heterogenious.

Blood for example.

## Deconvolution problem

Suppose that we want to mix some cell types. Let $W$ be an $n \times c$ matrix where $n$ is the number of genes and $c$ is the number of cell types. Matrix $W$ describes how every gene is expressed in concrete cell type. Let $H$ be an $c \times m$ matrix where $m$ is the number of samples we want to mix. Matrix $H$ describes in what proportions (frequencies) we want to mix our cell types, hence the sum of every column in $H$ has to be equal to one.

Mixing process can be modeled using linear model:
$$ X = W \times H$$
where resulting $n \times m$ matrix describes how each gene is expressed in the resuling heterogenious mix.

Deconvolution problem is about opposite process. 

Observed gene expression matrix $X$ is given to us and we want to find such matrices $W$ and $H$ that

$$ O \approx W \times H$$
